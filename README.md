# Receiptify-Clone

## Introduction
Identeafy is a clone of Receiptify, a site where users can log in with their Spotify accounts and find out their music stats.
The stats will then be shown in the form of an ID Card.
It's similar to Spotify Wrapped but the stats are available to users at all times.

Available stats include: 
1) Top 10 tracks last month
2) Top 10 tracks for the last 6 months

I want to make Identeafy as I am a huge fan of Spotify and I don't want to wait for Spotify Wrapped to come out at the end of the year. 
I want to be able to access the stats as and when I want to and I want the stats to be shown in a different setting.

## Built With
1) Python 3.11.5
2) Flask 3.0.0
3) HTML
4) CSS
5) JS
