# Receiptify-Clone

## Introduction
This web app is a clone of Receiptify, a site where users can log in with their Spotify accounts and find out their music stats. 
It's similar to Spotify Wrapped but the stats are available at all times and the stats are presented in a form of a receipt.

Available stats include: 
1) Top song tracks
2) Top music artists
3) Top music genres

Users can find their stats for a specific period of time i.e last month, last six months or all-time.

I want to clone Receiptify as I am a huge fan of Spotify and I don't want to wait for Spotify Wrapped to come out at the end of the year. I want to be able to access the stats as and when I want to.

## Built With
1) Python 3.11.5
2) Flask 3.0.0
3) HTML
4) CSS
